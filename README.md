rateFetcher
===========

Experimental GO project that downloads currency exchange rates from apirates.com and stores them in a local sqlite3 database.
The idea is to run this using a cron job and later query the database with other tools to run analysis, email notifications, etc.

For now this is simply a GO playground :)
